# Covey

Covey is a minimal, family-focused calendar that brings your iCloud calendars into beautifully designed interface that can live anywhere in your home. It can run locally on a computer or server or can be added to a tablet Home Screen like an app. No third party services or subscriptions needed. 

## Features

- Month and week calendar views
- Create, update, and delete events in iCloud Calendar
- Optional reminders and dinner calendars
- Sync status indicator with offline and retry states
- Light and dark themes, including scheduled theme changes
- Multiple color palettes and adjustable text size
- Calendar visibility filters
- Preferences saved in the browser
- Minimal interface that fades secondary controls when idle
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices
- App icon, launch splash screen, and iOS Home Screen support
- Open-source project designed to run on your own infrastructure

## Calendars

Covey comes with support for three calendars out of the box. A family calendar for all family activity, dinner calendar to track meals and reminders calendar for general family reminders.

In the future we will be adding support for separate individual calendars. 

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.6 or newer
- An iCloud account
- An Apple app-specific password

## iCloud setup

Covey connects to iCloud using CalDAV. Apple requires an app-specific password for third-party applications; your normal Apple ID password will not work.

1. Sign in to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com).
2. Open **Sign-In and Security**.
3. Select **App-Specific Passwords**.
4. Generate a password for Covey and save it somewhere secure.

You will use your Apple ID email address and this generated password in Covey's environment configuration.

## Installing

Install via Github by downloading this package to your device or by using npm.

via git clone:
``` git clone https://github.com/vinceangeloni/Covey/ ```

via npm:
``` npm install covey-calendar ```

## Configuration

After installing dependencies, run the setup wizard:

```sh
npm run setup
```

The wizard asks for your Apple ID email, an app-specific password (the input is masked), and the name of an existing iCloud calendar for events. Reminders and dinner calendars are optional. It saves the credentials to `.env` with owner-only file permissions. Use an app-specific password, not your normal Apple ID password; create one at [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com/).

You can also run `npm start` without configuring credentials first. Covey detects missing iCloud credentials, launches the setup wizard in the terminal, and starts the server after setup completes. If `.env` already exists, the wizard asks before updating iCloud settings and preserves unrelated entries. To configure Covey without an interactive terminal, copy `.env_sample` to `.env` and edit it manually. Never commit `.env` or share your app-specific password.

Calendar names entered during setup must match calendars that already exist in iCloud. The event calendar defaults to `Family`; confirm or change it to match your account. Covey creates `data/calendars.json` on first launch. It contains calendar IDs, iCloud calendar names, and types (`event`, `reminder`, or `dinner`). Legacy `CALENDAR_NAME`, `REMINDERS_CALENDAR`, and `DINNER_CALENDAR` values in `.env` seed this file only on first launch. The generated `data/` directory is ignored by Git so each installation keeps its own settings.

The Calendars tab lets you add calendars by name, choose from eight preset colors and icons, and confirm the calendar already exists in iCloud. Covey also checks the name with iCloud before saving. Calendar records are persisted in `data/calendars.json`; direct file edits require a server restart. The config API's `PUT /api/config/calendars` replaces the full list, so include every calendar you want to keep. Calendar names must match existing iCloud calendars (case-insensitive). To store the file somewhere else, set `COVEY_DATA_DIR` to a writable directory. Never commit `.env` or share your app-specific password.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and start the server. On first launch, `npm start` opens setup if iCloud credentials are missing:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The server reads `.env` at startup. If you change your configuration, stop and restart Covey.

## How it works

Covey is a small Node.js application:

- `server.js` runs the Express web server and exposes the calendar API.
- `calendar-store.js` validates and persists per-install calendar configuration in `data/calendars.json`.
- `tsdav` handles CalDAV communication with iCloud.
- `ical.js` parses and generates iCalendar data.
- `index.html` contains the web application UI.
- `style.css` contains the shared stylesheet.

Calendar events are read from and written to iCloud through the server. The browser does not connect directly to iCloud.

## Privacy and local storage

Covey does not provide a separate hosted account system. The iCloud credentials configured in `.env` are used by the server to access the configured calendars.

Interface preferences—such as theme, text size, selected view, and calendar visibility—are stored in your browser's `localStorage`. These preferences remain local to that browser and are not uploaded to Covey.

Your calendar data remains in iCloud, subject to Apple's account and calendar settings.

## Add Covey to a Home Screen

Run Covey on a computer or server your mobile device can reach, then open it in the device's browser.

- **iPhone or iPad:** In Safari, choose **Share → Add to Home Screen**.
- **Android:** In Chrome, open the menu and choose **Install app** or **Add to Home screen**.

Covey includes iOS icons and an Android web app manifest with 192×192 and 512×512 icons. For Android's full app-style installation, serve Covey over HTTPS (or use `localhost` on the device).

## Open source
